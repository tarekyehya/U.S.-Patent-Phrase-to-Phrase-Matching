 fine-tuning with transformers\n","    -  useing best practice hyperpramters from other comptitions wthout tuning them (i like to spend more time with the second approach^^) \n","    -  working more and more with the inputs and the data that will finetune with.\n","    -  testing coustom loss function, pearson correlation, worked well with the first eboach only!, need more debug but the same was worked with the pytorch model.\n","    -  working with the task as a classification task with only one label.\n","    \n","- ### second approach:\n","    -  taking the last hidden state of the encoder based model ( like debarta ) then build some layears like an decoder above it.\n","    -  training the whole model with hyperpramters that were tuning well\n","    -  using custom loss function with some tricks, pearson correlation (pearson correlation is the evaluate metric of the competition) worked better than BCEWithLogitsLoss\n","    -  using AWP from the third eboach\n","    -  using attention pooling and an initialization weights that worked better than the default\n","    -  shuffle a part of the input sequence (for every example) in every traing step (the trick worked well in the cross validation score)\n","    -  a trick for GPU limitations when working with bigger models and more long input sequnces :\n","        -  in every batch, declare different max_len for the tokenizar based on the max input length in this batch, after sorting the df, this trick make me able to use deberta-v3-large with a long sequnce inputs and batch size = 4 \n","    -  last save the best models from every training (the best score on the validation set for every fold), then averaging them.\n","- ### general tricks :\n","    -  i use StratifiedGroupKFold for cross validation for two reasons, first the data was groubed by the anchor (very important note), second the data is imbalance.\n","    -  adding related data from other sources\n","    -  groupby(['anchor', 'context'])['target'] added to the input \n","    - [link of the notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarekyahia/feature-extraction-approach) \n","- ### tricks i want to implement in the comming version :\n","    -  work more with the nn model, test add bi-lstm and test more tricks in this point.\n","    -  save the best models from the first approach and use in the final subbmission else.\n","    -  test different and bigger LLM anc combine the results of the best in more robust way than just averaging.\n","    -  freaze almost all deberta layers, and almost work only with the \"decoder\" part.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"b842512a","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-22T21:47:23.124441Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-22T21:47:23.123981Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-22T21:47:44.318086Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-22T21:47:44.317015Z"},"papermill":{"duration":21.208821,"end_time":"2024-01-22T21:47:44.32071","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-22T21:47:23.111889","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.24.3\n","  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib .pyplot as plt\n","import re\n","import random\n","import os\n","from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedGroupKFold,GroupKFold,KFold\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","from torch import nn \n","from datasets import Dataset,DatasetDict,Value\n","from torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n","from torch.optim import Adam, SGD, AdamW\n","from datasets import DatasetDict\n","from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification,AutoTokenizer\n","from transformers import TrainingArguments,Trainer\n","from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, AutoConfig\n","from copy import deepcopy\n","from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy\n","\n","\n","\n","device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"5066c631","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-22T21:47:44.345149Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-22T21:47:44.344382Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-22T21:47:45.926088Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-22T21:47:45.924832Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.596972,"end_time":"2024-01-22T21:47:45.928897","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-22T21:47:44.331925","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/convert_slow_tokenizer.py:473: UserWarning: The sentencepiece tokenizer that you are converting to a fast tokenizer uses the byte fallback option which is not implemented in the fast tokenizers.
